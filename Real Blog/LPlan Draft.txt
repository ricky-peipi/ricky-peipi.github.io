The way I will manage myself and workload to make sure i'm being productive is by, making certain days where I schedule different aspects of the task. Like for example I usually make the first two days of a sprint research days.
That way I can ensure that I known enough to begain the tasks for the rest of the week. But in an event that I forget,I would then go back to notes that I made during my research period.
Now the way I will make sure that I work safely/productive with the Dev Academy staff is by making sure I don't overload or hassle them with too many questions in one day. And letting them take there time to respond to me.
But also if I work something out before my fellow cohorts, I will help them as best as I can.
When things get hard though, I will make sure I try to solve it then ask for help. As if I don't try it myself I wouldn't learn as much.

To be honest all that I expect from the facilitation team. Is for help to be readily avalible, which it has been.
The only scheduling conflicts I have are my infusions that happen every 8 weeks at the hospital, that differ on length depending on the amount of people in the hospital.
