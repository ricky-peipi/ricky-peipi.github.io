        <h2 id="h11">Reflect on how confident you feel using the problem solving techniques and process:</h2>
        <p id="p11"> .Pseudocode
            .Trying something
            .Rubber ducky method
            .Reading error messages
            .Console.logging
            .Googling
            .Asking your peers for help
            .Asking coaches for help
            .Improving your process with reflection </p>

        <p id="p12">If i'm being really honest, when it comes to Pseudocode I am not very confident with the technique. As often I make various misatakes with spacing and case sensitive words. But in terms of formatting I do feel very confident with laying out code correctly for the computer to understand.</p>   

        <img id="pic2" src="P code.jpg" alt="This" style="width:500px;height:450px;">

        <p id="p13">Ok so when it comes to trying something I am very confident in using the method. Which mainly involves looking at various ways to solving a code question and using trial and error going through various ways till the correct one becomes apparent.</p>

        <p id="p13">Unfourntunatly when it comes to the rubber ducky method I am not confident at all. As I often only understand what the entire chunk of code does and only a handful of the code that makes up the complete function/chunk.</p>

        <p id="p13">With error messages, I find it very helpful as when I am using javascript. Errors appear a lot, and the message can inform me that a value is not defined or the way the code is formatted is inccorect and that once its fixed the code will then work. So my confidence level would probably be 8 out of 10.</p>

        <p id="p13">Console logging, using a line of code that looks like this: console.log. and then adding a value in a bracket () will then make a word that you put in the code appear in the console part of the devtools feature in a web browser. This can also help with seeing if a return function works, by returing the specific value. I am fairly confident when it comes to using this method.</p>

        <p id="p13">Finally for the methods of Googling, Asking your peers for help, Asking coaches for help and improving your process with reflection. I can say that I am confident with these methods. As I tend to google ways of writting code often as google can show and explaing how one line of code can be changed and altered for various things. And when I do get stuck I do ask my fellow cohorts to guide me as they remember things that I tend to forget some aspects specificly in javascript. This does extend to using the tutor/facillatator. I do ask for guidence with asking how the certain code would be written as my way of writing code is incorrect or could be more clearer. Now finally when it comes to using reflections, I often use them to refreash my brain on what I did because I tend to write them striaght after I have completed a task, and a reminder helps a lot. So my confidence in this method is very high.</p>

        <p>
        The one time that I needed to use problem solving techniques, was very recently when I was working on the superfizz exercise and I was stuck for the entire day. I had then asked a fellow cohort and then he told me that my code was in the wrong sequence/order. So wothout using the problem solving technique of asking for help I would have been stuck for a while. Now for using problem solving techniques elegantly, I cannot recall an moment where I did that.
