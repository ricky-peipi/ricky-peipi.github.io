              <p1 id="para">Well I don't often get into these types of situations, but when I was at home one of my other siblings was skipping chores,and pinning it on the other sibling. Later my parents were going at that sibling, so I chose to sell out that sibling as ethically letting That
                  sibling get into trouble for no reason was funny but not right.

              <h3 id="headingvalue3">Describe how your culture has influenced your values and identity.</h3>
              <p2 id="para2">Pop culture affected who I am a lot. The super hero movies in particular shaped my morals and values like for example the hulk is about the dangers of anger and iron man teaches you about cockiness and ego.
                  And video games help shape me into the tech wise adult I am today.

              <h4 id="headingvalue4">Evaluate your strengths and limitations in terms of your learning and career development</h4>
              <p3 id="para3">Ok let's start with my strengths. I would say that my strengths are as follows, I can pick up tech related things quite quickly, I find it easier to stay quiet and concentrated and finally I would say my final strength would be that I am quick to finish work.
                Now for my weaknesses, I would say that even though I can finish work quickly. I tend to make small misatakes that I woundln't see unless told.And finally my ability to stay quiet does hinder my willingness to ask for help.</p3>

              <h5 id="headingvalue5">Identify which of your strengths might help you in your learning journey and how they might intersect with learning obstacles.</h5>
              <p4 id="para3">Well as stated above I found that I naturally pick up tech related info up quicker than I would other things. And when i'm focused I can usually get things done within a couple of days
                  So I find that I can quite quickly overcome the obstacles.
              </p4>

              <h6 id="headingvalue6">Share an example from your experience of where you were trying to work productively with others, but there was resistance or tension. Discuss the strategies you used at that time, how effective they were, and your reflections on what other strategies you would try now, and why.</h6>
              <p5 id="para4">Back when I was on another course for computing we were put in groups, and the whole team got the same grade in which we found out that one of us wasn't getting things done. So a low grade we be given out. So as a team we quickly tried to assit that team member.
                  So back then there was really no stratgies. So they were not affective at all. But these days my new strategies are to complete most of my work than ask others if they need help with anything which has been good so far.
                  If I were to try any new strategies now it would be to ask my other coherts for help a bit more.
