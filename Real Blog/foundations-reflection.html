       <h2 id="h12"> Reflecting on the enitire experience</h2>

       <h id="h14">
         What are three new things you have learnt about yourself and your ego as a result of the core learning? </h>
           

        <p id="p15">
          The three things I would say I had learned about myself is that one despite having an enire week to finish my work, I can't contain my excitement and then I end up finishing work some what fast. The sceond would be while I can put out the correct line of code, my little syntax errors does help me learn but it also drastically slows me down and then my ego get shattered. And finally the final thing I would say I learned about myself is that I can ask for help, but I feel I ask for it as much as I should.</p>

        <h id="h16">
          What are the role of values, empathy, and self awareness in learning and programming?</h>

        <p id="p17">
          Ok so values are very important as ones like empathy help you understand how your fellow cohorts/project members where they are and how they are going, cause if they are not doing so well you can help them back up so they don't fall behind the mission. But I would say the most important one is absolutly self awareness. Self awareness is helpful as it helps anyone know or realise if they have gaps in there method of learning/programming and then they can adpat off that gap in knowledge. This can also be extended to knowing when things get rough and when you may need a break or two.</p>

        <h id="h18">What has surprised you the most about the core learning?
        What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?</h>

        <p id="p19">What surprised me the most about the core learning, was how much was not focused on coding and more on how we learn and how our learning methods can be enhanced. And also realising how we ourseleves learn and expand.</p>

        <h id="h20">Why do you think that we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core learning in a web development bootcamp course?</h>

        <p id="p21">To me the intention is pretty clear, having learned different ways to a problem will help me and others for the rest of my/there lives.
        But giving everyone the humans skills that would help benefit working in jobs and just dealing with over whelming moments, and this course did give the key to help regulate the emotional damage that might come up.
        </p>

        <h id="h22">Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you have just used that time to practise programming instead? Justify your answer.</h>

        <p id="p23">I do think that some time was wasted on doing the on core learning, but as I reached near the end of the 5 week Foundations period. I must admit it did come in handy just for managing how I used my time, and helping with the constant workflow week after week. So the core learning did benefit the coding but more in a background type of sense.</p>
