       <h2 id="h7"> What is the difference between IQ and EQ?</h2>

       <p1 id="p6"> EQ or emotional quotient is a measurement of someones ability to identify emotions in others and yourself, empathise with other people, change or adapt your feelings and behaviour to different situations.
            This also extends out to the ability to control impulses and temptations, resolve conflicts and to communicate well.

            Well Iq or intelligence quotient is a persons ability to solve problems, plan things, understand abstract or difficult ideas and to learn or adapt to changes
            and grasp and use language.</p1>
            <img id="pic4" src="Real Blog/int.png" alt="This" style="width:500px;height:450px;">
            <p2 id="p7">Another way one could understand the concepts is that IQ is more of the educational side that requires learnt knowledge. and EQ could be thought as the social side.
                You could think of Sheldon from the Big Bang Theory. His IQ is out the roof, things like maths and memory he crushes. But his EQ is very low, he fails to see emotions in others and when he gets overwhelmed he breaks down.</p2>

                <p3 id="p8">The reason that IQ and EQ are important is that one needs the other. As since IQ helps a person with the working and problem solving part. Knowing how to regulate pressures when they arise will help people in stressful jobs or in life.</p3>
