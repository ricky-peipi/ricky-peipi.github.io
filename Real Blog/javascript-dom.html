        <h2 id="h7">What is the difference between Html and CSS?</h2>
        <p id="p6"> Well Html can be seen as the body/framework that houses all the neccesary code so people can view the website. And Css is like someones clothes they go on top of the Html, it shows the changes of colour text and the aligning of the text. So the appearance of a website like clothes on a person.</p>
         
        <h3 id="h8">Explain control flow and loops using an example process from everyday life, for example 'waking up' or 'brushing your teeth'. (But not those ones).</h3>

        <p7 id="p7">Well control flow is a method a computer will use to execute commands in a specific order like turn on, load OS, display picture etc. And loops are when the computer executes statements then executes them over and over again.</p7>

        <h4 id="h8">Describe what the DOM is and an example of how you might interact with it.</h4>

        <p8 id="p8">Well the DOM or Document Object Model is like the heirachy of Html. laid out like a tree it shows how html like codes are link to each other. One way one might interact with the DOM is by using ctrl + shift + I and changing a word from boo to boom.</p8>

        <h9 id="h9">Explain the difference between accessing data from arrays and objects.</h9>

        <p9 id="p9">Well accessing data from an Array is different because an array can store a whole list of different values/data. But the way to access it is by using these things Dot property accessor: object. property.
            Square brackets property access: object['property']
            Object destructuring: const { property } = object.  Where as an object is similar to an array but the way to access them is by using the arrays index position. The index position is refering to the memory address where the value is stored. </p9>

        <h10 id="h10">Explain what functions are and why they are useful.</h10>

        <p10 id="p10">Well a function is seen as a set of commands or statements that come together to preform a task like returing a word or number.The reason why functions are useful, is that if a series of task are similar to eachother a function can be ues to solve all the tasks at once.</p10>
