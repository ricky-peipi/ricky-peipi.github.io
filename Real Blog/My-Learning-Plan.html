              <h3 id="h3">What is my long term goal and/or career pathway</h3>
              <p2 id="p2">My plan/long term goal is to in the future claim a place in a tech company like sony (playstation) and programme video games. As video games are what set me on my path in I.T.</p2>
              <h4 id="h4">A description of your own strengths and limitations in relation to learning</h4>
              <p3 id="p3">Ok let's start with my strengths. I would say that my strengths are as follows, I can pick up tech related things quite quickly, I find it easier to stay quiet and concentrated and finally I would say my final strength would be that I am quick to finish work.
                  Now for my weaknesses, I would say that even though I can finish work quickly. I tend to make small misatakes that I woundln't see unless told.And finally my ability to stay quiet does hinder my willingness to ask for help.</p3>
              <h4 id="h5">What skills (non-technical-human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?</h4>
              <p4 id="p4">The non-tech skill I would love to develop, is quite simple.Being able to ask for help more confidently.</p4>
              <h6 id="h6">A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme.</h6>
              <p5 id="p5">The way I will manage myself and workload to make sure i'm being productive is by, making certain days where I schedule different aspects of the task. Like for example I usually make the first two days of a sprint research days.
                That way I can ensure that I known enough to begain the tasks for the rest of the week. But in an event that I forget,I would then go back to notes that I made during my research period.
                Now the way I will make sure that I work safely/productive with the Dev Academy staff is by making sure I don't overload or hassle them with too many questions in one day. And letting them take there time to respond to me.
                But also if I work something out before my fellow cohorts, I will help them as best as I can.
                When things get hard though, I will make sure I try to solve it then ask for help. As if I don't try it myself I wouldn't learn as much anyway.
                
                To be honest all that I expect from the facilitation team. Is for help to be readily avalible, which it has been.
                The only scheduling conflicts I have are my infusions that happen every 8 weeks at the hospital, that differ on length depending on the amount of people in the hospital.
